    "prompt": "Straight-on, eye-level view of a small independent boutique interior with a large plaster wall painted in soft teal limewash, subtly shifting from pale teal near the ceiling to medium teal toward the floor. Soft morning window light creates a gentle top-to-bottom tonal gradient on the real wall surface. A stylish customer (mid-30s, East Asian woman) stands near the right edge browsing a simple clothes rack of neutral linens. Minimal, real furnishings: a light wood bench and a single potted plant at the lower left. Clean, uncluttered negative space across most of the wall. Natural color palette, no screens, no signage, no posters, no whiteboards, no text.",
